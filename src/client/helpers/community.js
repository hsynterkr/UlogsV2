"Communities" is a core aspect of the ulogs.org ecosystem. A ulog-community is a community born around the art of ulogging. &nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
A ulog-subtag however, is a simple fusion between #ulog and a hashtag. Ulog-subtags simplifies the art of ulogging while maintaining its essence, by allowing users to ulog about niche-based topics. It also further incites users to be inventive with content-creation, unites existing STEEM communities by drawing "true fans" towards these communities and enhances content creation/curation. &nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
Each ulog-subtag has the potential of emanating a ulog-community. You can take a step towards creating a ulog-community, if you are a "certified ulogger". &nbsp;  
&nbsp;
